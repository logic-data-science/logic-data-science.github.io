<p>
The workshop will be held on January 11th and 12th.
</p>

<p>
The programme has four axes, starting from a theoretical standpoint and going to a more practical one: logic and automata, verification, programming languages, and neural networks.
</p>

<p>
There will be 12 invited speakers. Each of the invited speaker either has recently incorporated the learning paradigm into his work, or has proposed some new point of view on an aspect of learning.
</p>

<p>
The programme will not be very dense (about 5h per day) so as to give enough time for discussions.
