In this talk, I will discuss some recent developments about boundedness games. 
They are two-player games played over (finite or infinite) graphs, featuring counters that can be incremented, reset of left unchanged. The first player's objective is to satisfy a parity condition and that the counter values are bounded. 

They appear in different contexts, for instance in the theory of regular cost-functions and of cost-MSO logic as defined by Thomas Colcombet, as well as in the study of MSO + U as defined by Miko{\l}aj Boja{\'n}czyk. 
However, the approaches are different, hence the games obtained have a different flavour: the theory of regular cost-functions give rise to cost-games, where the counter values are bounded uniformly over all paths, whereas MSO + U induces omega B games, where for each path there is a bound on the counter values. 

A lot of questions are open: what is the algorithmic complexity to decide the winner and construct winning strategies, when are the two models (uniform and non-uniform) equivalent, and does there always exist finite-memory winning strategies? 
In particular, proving the existence of finite-memory winning strategies for (some) boundedness games is the last missing item to prove the decidability of cost-MSO over infinite trees, which would in his fall imply the decidability of the non-deterministic Mostowski index, a long-standing open problem. 

I will give an overview of where we stand now and what are the next challenges.
