        <dt>Title:</dt>
        <dd>A short tutorial on differential privacy</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
            Differential privacy is a robust mathematical framework for designing privacy-preserving computations on sensitive data. In this tutorial we will cover the key definitions and intuitions behind differential privacy and introduce the core building blocks used by most differentially private mechanisms.
            <br/><br/>
The first half of the tutorial will introduce the basic ideas and provide a brief survey of some of their applications in privacy-preserving machine learning. In the second half of the tutorial we will present several variants of the original definition of differential privacy, and discuss the roles each of these definitions plays in practical applications.Two known shortcomings of standard techniques in formal verification are the limited capability to provide system-level assertions, and the scalability to large-scale, complex models, such as those needed in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.  Using data, which nowadays is becoming ever more accessible, has the potential to mitigate such limitations. However, this notoriously leads to a lack of formal proofs that are needed in safety-critical systems.

        <dt>Title:</dt>
        <dd>In-Database Factorised Learning</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
        In this talk I will overview recent results in the Factorised DataBases project at Oxford (<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/projects/FDB/index.html">see project webpage</a>). 
        I will first discuss how factorised databases can avoid  redundancy in the representation and computation of query results in relational databases. For conjunctive queries, their factorised results can be arbitrarily more succinct than their standard listing representation. I will then explain how this approach can be applied to lower the complexity of machine learning over data residing in databases. Recent joint work with collaborators from industry shows that in-database factorised learning can speed up real analytical workloads in the retail domain by several orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art systems. This work is based on long-standing collaboration with Maximilian Schleich and Jakub Zavodny and more recent collaboration with Mahmoud Abo-Khamis, Hung Ngo, and XuanLong Nguyen.

        <dd>Formal verification of complex systems: model-based and data-driven methods</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
            Two known shortcomings of standard techniques in formal verification are the limited capability to provide system-level assertions, and the scalability to large-scale, complex models, such as those needed in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) applications.  Using data, which nowadays is becoming ever more accessible, has the potential to mitigate such limitations. However, this notoriously leads to a lack of formal proofs that are needed in safety-critical systems.  
            <br/><br/>
            This talk covers research which addresses these shortcomings, by bringing model-based and data-driven methods together, which can help pushing the envelope of existing algorithms and tools in formal verification.  
            <br/><br/>
            In the first part of the talk, I will discuss a new, formal, measurement-driven and model-based automated technique, for the quantitative verification of systems with partly unknown dynamics. I will formulate this setup as a data-driven Bayesian inference problem, formally embedded within a quantitative, model-based verification procedure. I argue that the approach can be applied to complex physical systems (e.g., with spatially continuous variables), driven by external inputs and accessed under noisy measurements. 
<br/><br/>
In the later part of the talk, I will concentrate on systems represented by models that are probabilistic with heterogeneous dynamics (continuous/discrete, i.e. hybrid, as well as nonlinear). Such stochastic hybrid models (SHS) are a natural mathematical framework for CPS. With focus on model-based verification procedures, I will provide algorithms for quantitative model checking of temporal specifications on SHS with formal guarantees. This is attained via the development of formal abstraction techniques based on quantitative approximations. 
<br/><br/>
Theory is complemented by algorithms, all packaged in a software tool that is available to users, and applied in the domain of Smart Energy.

            <dt>Abstract:</dt>
            <dd>
                In this talk we will discuss learning automata and context-free grammars in the exact query framework (Angluin, 1987).
                We will start by discussing the general problem of learning when the instance space consists of discrete combinatorial objects like strings (trees, graphs and so on), and the minimally 			adequate teacher learning model, where the learner only has access to two sorts of queries: membership queries and equivalence queries. 
                <br/>
                We will then present Angluin's L-star algorithm for learning all regular sets via deterministic finite state automata, and extensions of this approach to the problem of learning  			interesting subclasses of context-free grammars, and mildly context-sensitive extensions thereof.

        <dd>Safety Verification of Deep Neural Networks</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
Deep neural networks have achieved impressive experimental results in image classification, but can surprisingly be unstable with respect to adversarial perturbations, that is, minimal changes to the input image that cause the network to misclassify it. With potential applications including perception modules and end-to-end controllers for self-driving cars, this raises concerns about their safety. Safety assurance of conventional software components is typically achieved using automated verification, but such methods are little studied for machine learning components. This lecture is based on a paper to appear in CAV 2017 and will focus on safety of image classification decisions defined in terms of invariance of the classification with respect to image manipulations within a small neighbourhood of the original image. The techniques have been implemented using Microsoft Z3, evaluated on state-of-the-art networks, including regularised and deep learning networks, and compared to existing tools to estimate network robustness with encouraging results.

        <dd>Continuity and Transductions: A Theory of Composability</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
Formal models for the computation of problems, say circuits, automata, Turing machines, can be naturally extended to compute word-to-word functions. But abstracting from the computation model, what does it mean to "lift" a language class to functions? In this talk, that question is addressed in a first step by developing a robust theory that incidentally revolves around the (topological) notion of continuity. In language-theoretic terms, a word-to-word function is V-continuous, for a class of languages V, if it preserves membership in V by inverse image. In a second step, the focus is put on transducers, i.e. automata with letter output. The natural problem at hand is then that of deciding whether a given transducer realizes a V-continuous function; this is shown decidable for some classical classes V (e.g. a periodic languages, group languages, piecewise-testable...). 
If time allows, the correlation between the transducer structure (i.e. its transition monoid), and its computing a continuous function will be explored.

        <dd>Invariant Synthesis for Linear Dynamical Systems</dd>

        <dt>Abstract:</dt>
        <dd>
The Orbit Problem consists of determining, given a linear
transformation A on Q^d, together with vectors x and y, whether
the orbit of x under repeated applications of A can ever reach y.
<br/>
We will investigate this problem with a different point of view:  is it possible to synthesise suitable invariants, that is,
subsets of Q^d that contain x but not y. Such invariants provide  natural certificates for negative instances of the Orbit  Problem. We will show that semialgebraic invariants exist in all  reasonable cases. A more recent (yet unpublished) result is that  existence of semilinear invariants is decidable.
